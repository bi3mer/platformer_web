# Levels

All level segments are in the [segments](./segments) directory. [graph.json](./graph.json) defines the MDP. Note, I would rather use a node editor, or interactive, rather than definite all edges and rewards with a JSON file, but I didn't find a tool that was easy enough to use such that it would be faster for me to learn it and use it than just typing it manually. I still want to change this, just out of principle.
